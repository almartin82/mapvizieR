# Visual Test Snapshots

This directory contains visual regression test snapshots created by the `vdiffr` package.

## What are these files?

The `.svg` files in this directory are reference snapshots of plots generated by the mapvizieR package. These snapshots are used to detect visual changes in plots across package updates.

## How do they work?

When you run the visual tests in `test-visual-plots.R`, vdiffr compares the current plot output against these reference snapshots. If there are differences, the tests will fail, alerting you to potential visual regressions.

## When do I need to update them?

You should update these snapshots when:

1. You intentionally change the appearance of a plot (e.g., updating colors, layout, or styling)
2. You upgrade a dependency (like ggplot2) that changes plot rendering
3. The initial snapshots are created for the first time

## How do I update them?

To manage and update snapshots, you can use:

```r
# In an interactive R session
library(testthat)
library(vdiffr)

# Run tests and manage snapshots interactively
vdiffr::manage_cases()

# Or validate snapshots from command line
testthat::snapshot_accept()
```

## Important Notes

- **Never** manually edit the `.svg` files
- **Always** review snapshot changes carefully before accepting them
- **Commit** snapshot changes along with code changes that cause visual updates
- These tests are skipped on CRAN to avoid platform-specific rendering differences
