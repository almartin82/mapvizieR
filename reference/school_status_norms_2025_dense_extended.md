# school_status_norms_2025_dense_extended 2025 school norm data densified and extended

Builds on status_norms_2025 for schools. Two data processing steps have
been performed: 1) densification by percentile 2) extending norms into
HS grades See student_status_norms_2025_dense_extended for more details.
Note: Original 2025 norms only include 5-point percentile intervals.
