# student_status_norms_2025_dense_extended 2025 student norm data densified and extended

Builds on status_norms_2025 for students. Two data processing steps have
been performed: 1) densification by percentile - creates entries for
intermediate percentiles 2) extending norms into HS grades where data
may be sparse Note: Original 2025 norms only include 5-point percentile
intervals.
