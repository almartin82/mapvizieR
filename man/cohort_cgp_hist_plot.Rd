\arguments{
\item{mapvizieR_obj}{conforming mapvizieR obj}

\item{studentids}{vector of studentids}

\item{measurementscale}{target subject}

\item{match_method}{do we limit to matched students, and if so, how?
no matching = any student record in the studentids.
UNIMPLEMENTED METHODS / TODO
strict = only kids who appear in all terms
strict after imputation = impute first, then use stritc method
back one = look back one test term, and only include kids who can be matched}

\item{first_and_spring_only}{show all terms, or only entry & spring?
default is TRUE.}

\item{entry_grade_seasons}{which grade_level_seasons are entry grades?}

\item{school_norms}{c(2012, 2015).  what school norms to use?  default
is 2012.}

\item{primary_cohort_only}{will determine the most frequent cohort and limit to 
students in that cohort.  designed to handle discrepancies in grade/cohort
pattern caused by previous holdovers.  default is TRUE.}
