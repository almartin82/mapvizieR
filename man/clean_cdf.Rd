\arguments{
\item{cdf_list}{the output of read cdf}

\item{ids_df}{a data frame with the bad studentid, and the good replacement.
look at the default parameter value to see how to pass the data.}

same output as read_cdf, a list of NWEA MAP data files
}
\description{
if you've identified some bad studentids in your map data file, 
you'll want to make sure that they are globally updated to good ones.  this function
takes the output of read cdf and a data frame of studentids to change, and updates
the bad references with good ones.

ultimately you'll want to push these changes upstream to the NWEA site, but in a
pinch, clean_cdf can help
