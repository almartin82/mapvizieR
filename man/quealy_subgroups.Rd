\arguments{
\item{mapvizieR_obj}{mapvizieR object}

\item{studentids}{target students}

\item{measurementscale}{target subject}

\item{subgroup_cols}{what subgroups in mapvizier roster do you want to cut by?  default
is starting_quartile}

\item{pretty_names}{nicely formatted names for the column cuts used above.}

\item{magic_subgroups}{generated by mapvizieR.  possible values include: 
'starting_quartile'}

\item{start_fws}{one academic season (if known); pass vector of two and quealy subgroups will pick}

\item{start_year_offset}{0 if start season is same, -1 if start is prior year.}

\item{end_fws}{ending season}

\item{end_academic_year}{ending academic year}

\item{start_fws_prefer}{which term is preferred? not required if only one start_fws is passed}

\item{report_title}{text grob to put on the report tile}

\item{complete_obsv}{if TRUE, limit only to students who have BOTH a start
and end score. default is TRUE.}

\item{drop_NA_groups}{should we ignore subgroups with value NA?  default is true}

\item{include_all}{should the output have plot at the top showing the TOTAL
variation?  not recommended for data spanning multiple grade levels.}

\item{small_n_cutoff}{drop a subgroup if less than x% (as decimal) of the total pop? 
(useful for cutting off the long tail of a group).  applies to all subgroups in
subgroup_cols.  does not apply to magic subgroups.}

\item{join_by_measurementscale}{boolean, passed to roster_to_growth_df.  TRUE if
the subgroup col is per-subject.}

\item{school_growth_norms}{passed through to calc_cgp.  determines what norm study
to use.  default is 2015 (most recent study).}

\description{
kevin quealy of the nytimes did a nice job capturing change 
in the general population vs change in specific subgroups: http://nyti.ms/1tQrOIl 
re: obamacare.
let's do the same thing for change in RIT score.
