\usage{
report_dispatcher(mapvizieR_obj, cut_list, call_list, func_to_call,
  arg_list = list(), calling_env = parent.frame(),
  pre_process = function(x) return(x),
  post_process = "only_valid_plots", verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapvizieR_obj}{a conforming mapvizieR object.}

\item{cut_list}{a list of 'org units' in your roster, in order from most general
to most specific.}

\item{call_list}{a list of booleans.  must be the same length as cut_list.  indicates if
the function should get called at cut_list[i]}

\item{func_to_call}{function that will get passed to do.call}

\item{arg_list}{arguments to pass to do.call.  \code{report_dispatcher} will inject 
\code{studentids, depth_string} into the arg list, as well as named elements 
corresponding to the key/value cut and element outlined above}

\item{calling_env}{defaults to parent frame.}

\item{pre_process}{should we filter the list of unique org units?
helpful if you only want to run for one school, year, etc.  default is 
run everything.}

\item{post_process}{a post processing function to apply to the list of plots we get back.
default behavior is only_valid_plots(), which drops any plot that failed.  
don't want that?  write something new :)}

\item{verbose}{should the function print updates about what is happening?
default is TRUE.}

\item{...}{additional arguments}
}
\value{
a list of output from the function you called
}
\description{
