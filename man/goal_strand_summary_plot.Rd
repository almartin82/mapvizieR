\usage{
goal_strand_summary_plot(mapvizieR_obj, studentids, measurementscale,
  fws = c("Fall", "Winter", "Spring"), year, cohort = FALSE,
  spring_is_first = FALSE, filter_args = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapvizieR_obj}{a \code{mapvizieR} object}

\item{studentids}{vector of student id numbers for students to plot}

\item{measurementscale}{measurementscale to plot}

\item{fws}{seasons (fall, winter, or spring) as a character vector to plot}

\item{year}{academic year to plot}

\item{cohort}{cohort year to plot as integer or FALSE (the default).  If `cohort`
is not FALSE then `year` is ignored}

\item{spring_is_first}{logical indicating whether spring is in the given 
academic year or from the year prior.}

\item{filter_args}{a list of character vectors to filter `mapvizieR_obj$cdf` 
by that is passed to \code{\link[dplyr]{filter}}}
}
\value{
a ggplot2 object
}
\description{

goal strands.
}
\details{

of goal strand RIT scores
