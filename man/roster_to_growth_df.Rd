\usage{
roster_to_growth_df(target_df, mapvizieR_obj, roster_cols,
  join_by = "end", disambiguation_method = "last",
  by_measurementscale = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_df}{the df you want to put stuff on}

\item{mapvizieR_obj}{a conforming mapvizieR object}

\item{roster_cols}{roster column names you want to move over.}

\item{join_by}{c('start', 'end', 'both')}

\item{disambiguation_method}{how to disambiguate?  default is 'last'.}

\item{by_measurementscale}{boolean, when you have student demographics that are specific to a 
particular assessment - eg course enrollment, but the match is specific to student AND
measurementscale, not just student.  if TRUE your roster object must contain a field
called measurementscale.}
}
\value{
a growth data frame with the roster objects
}
\description{
when you need to put a roster object onto a growth data frame.
growth data frames are tricky, because they cover a time *span*, not a single point in time.
if a student changes school / grade / teacher (common) or if any of the other demographic attributes
of a student change (IEP status / lunch status / gender / etc.) you need to have a consistent rule for
attribution.  roster_to_growth_df implements that.
