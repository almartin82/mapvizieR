\description{
given a mapvizieR object, a vector of studentids, a subject, and a primary term, return 
a data frame of students and their baseline RIT scores. 
also has a fallback option - for instance, imagine you
were using a prior Spring score as baseline, but if a student was a new admit
in the fall, you wanted to roll them into the baseline.
