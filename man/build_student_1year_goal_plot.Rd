\usage{
build_student_1year_goal_plot(base_plot, mapvizieR_obj, studentid,
  measurementscale, start_grade, end_grade, labels_at_grade,
  growth_window = "Spring to Spring",
  localization = localize("Newark"), aspect_ratio = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_plot}{either the output of rit_height_weight_ACT,
rit_height_weight_npr, or a wrapper around one of those templates}

\item{mapvizieR_obj}{a conforming mapvizieR object}

\item{studentid}{one target studentid}

\item{measurementscale}{desired subject}

\item{start_grade}{show student history starting with this grade level.
We generally go back one year, to show the baseline that the goals derive 
from.}

\item{end_grade}{show student history ending with this grade level}

\item{labels_at_grade}{what grade level should the college labels 
print at?  Generally the student's most recent test grade_level_season
is desirable.}

\item{growth_window}{for looking up the window of SGP outcomes, what 
growth window should we use?}

\item{localization}{controls names/breakpoints for college labels and
ACT tiers.  See localization.R for more details}

\item{aspect_ratio}{college labels should print at the same
angle as the act ribbons.  if the viz is not square, this requires an
adjustment.  default value is 1, 0.5 would be a rectangle 2W for 1H.}
